            <p>
             I became fascinated by machine learning as a way to automate and 
             optimize these processes. The ability of machines to learn and 
             improve on their own seemed like a futuristic concept that I was 
             eager to explore and understand.

        A slight peek into my ideology and Beliefs
      </h2>
      <div class="bottom-line"></div>
      <p class="lead">
        I firmly believe that a good thought process for a successful B.Tech engineer 
        should include the following and I myself follow these.
      </p>
      <div class="process">
        <div>
          <i class="fas fa-solid fa-book-open fa-4x process-icon my-2">
            <div class="process-step">1</div>
          </i>
          <h3>Pursue a lifelong learning attitude</h3>
          <p>
            At the core of my engineering journey lies a belief in the power of lifelong learning. 
            As a B.Tech engineer, I understand the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest 
            industry trends and advancements. Whether it's attending workshops, networking events, 
            or reading academic journals, I'm committed to pursuing new knowledge and upgrading my 
            skills.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <i class="fas fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece fa-4x process-icon my-2">
            <div class="process-step">2</div>
          </i>
          <h3>Focus on problem-solving</h3>
          <p>
            I also believe that a problem-solving mindset is essential for success as an engineer.
            By understanding problems from multiple angles and using critical thinking to devise
            effective solutions, I can help drive innovation and make a real impact in my field.

            <div class="process-step">3</div>
          </i>
          <h3>Develop strong communication skills</h3>
          <p>
            Another crucial aspect of my approach to engineering is communication. As an engineer,
            it's essential to be able to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
            , collaborate effectively with team members, and present my ideas convincingly. By practicing
            my communication skills and building strong relationships with colleagues, I can help
            ensure that my work has a real-world impact.
          </p>

            <div class="process-step">4</div>
          </i>
          <h3>Build a strong network</h3>
          <p>
            Finally, I believe that building a strong network is crucial for success in any profession. 
            By attending industry events, participating in online forums, and joining professional 
            associations, I can expand my network and learn from the experiences of others in my field. 
            Together, these beliefs and practices make up my thought process as an engineer, and guide 
            me in my quest for success.
